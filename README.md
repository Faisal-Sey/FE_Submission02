## DOCS
The software is designed based on the online artisanal Halloween candy shop. It consists of three main functionalities namely;
1. An authentication system (i.e. login and logout system).
2. Dashboard systems summarizing all components of the software
3. Order systems displaying all orders with prices, product names, etc
